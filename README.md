### Switchando is now a deprecated project. The only way to install it is to compile it by yourself.



Hi everyone, I'm writing this post just to clarify some things.

Yes... It's been a long time. Many of you guys have asked me what happened and why Switchando hasn't been updated since April.
I founded Switchando (previously known as HomeAutomation 4.0) in September 2016, and as some of you know, HomeAutomation 4 has been a closed source project until June 2017.
HomeAutomation has been renamed in September 2017, the name "Switchando" was chosen by my dad, Paolo.

Switchando was getting bigger and bigger, and more and more people had started using it in their homes. Since I was the only one working on Switchando, maintaining it and supporting the community at the same time started to be stressful.

In June I wrote a message saying that Switchando would no longer be updated until September because I was working on other projects. I also planned an update for September, but it wasn't released.
Many of you guys have asked my why the September Update didn't came out but I've never given an answer to this question. The reason is that I was (and I think I'm still) in a bad mood for some personal reasons I don't want to tell you about.

Some of you may have guessed what I'm about to say: today I have officially stopped supporting Switchando, it will not be updated for an indefinite period. I'm only 16 years old, this project started taking me too much time, leaving me without free time to see some friends for over one year. I don't want this anymore, I want to spend my free time by going out with the few friends I have, not by staying all the day sitting in front of a computer.

So this mean that Switchando was just a waste of time for you? No, I've learned a lot from Switchando and now I have a lot of knowledges that I would never have had without it.

Are you still using Switchando in your home? Nope, I switched to Home Assistant, I don't really like it but it does what it has to do.

Before closing this post, I want to thank every one who believed in the project and supported it by offering me a lot of coffees.
Thank you so much guys.
<br />
Marco
