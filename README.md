Hi everyone, I'm writing this post just to clarify some things.

Yes... It's been a long time. Many of you guys have asked me what happened and why Switchando hasn't been updated since April 2018.
I founded Switchando (previously known as HomeAutomation 4.0) in September 2016, and as some of you know, HomeAutomation 4 has been a closed source project until June 2017.
HomeAutomation has been renamed in September 2017, the name "Switchando" was chosen by my dad, Paolo.

Switchando was getting bigger and bigger, and more and more people had started using it in their homes (big thanks to overVolt for the videos). Since I was the only one working on Switchando, maintaining it and supporting the community at the same time started to be stressful.

In June I wrote a message saying that Switchando would no longer be updated until September because I was working on other projects. I also planned an update for September, but it wasn't released.
Many of you guys have asked my why the September Update didn't came out but I've never given an answer to this question. The reason is that I was (and I think I'm still) in a bad mood for some personal reasons I don't want to tell you about.


Today I have officially stopped supporting Switchando, it will not be updated for an indefinite period. I'm only 16 years old, this project started taking me too much time, leaving me without free time.

Anyway, Switchando was not a waste of time. I've learned a lot from Switchando and now I have a lot of knowledges that I would never have had without it.

Are you still using Switchando in your home? Nope, I switched to Home Assistant (2021 update: I'm now contributing to the developement Home Assistant).

Before closing this post, I want to thank every one who believed in the project and supported it by offering me a lot of coffees.
Thank you so much guys.
<br />
Marco
