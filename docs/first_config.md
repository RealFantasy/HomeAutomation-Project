# Switchando Configuration

### First look
As you can see, once logged in Switchando you can see only a search bar in the top, that's because Switchando is not configured yet, let's see how can we manage to do it.

### The config-index
If you add /config-index.html in your URL, you'll see the configuration page. As you can see there are a very few options, that's because you don't have any plugin installed yet.

### Creating a room
The first thing you want to do is to create a room and add devices in it. Click on "â†’ Add a new room" in the config index, and you'll be asked for a name and for some optional friendly names, the name is the one that will be showed in the interface, friendly names are other names that are accepted in API calls (e.g. via voice commands).

### Adding your very first device
Once you've created a room, you surely want to add some devices in it, now you have to make sure the plugin for that device is installed and enabled, then click on the plugin name in the bottom of the config index and follow your plugin's guide to add your device, the plugin's setup will ask also for the room you want to add your device into.

### Does it work?
Just click on "> back to home" on the top of the config index and you'll be able to see the room and the device you've just added.
